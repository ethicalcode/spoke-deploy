You can deploy this deployer to your own Heroku too:

## What does it do?

Spoke Deploy helps you collect the info you need to set up Spoke, the P2P texting app. It also configures your Auth0 and Twilio accounts automatically for Spoke. 
When you're finished, you'll have a one-click ready to deploy Spoke app that your supporters and campaigners can start using right away.


### Prerequisites

During Deployment, you'll need to sign up for an account with Auth0 and Twilio. You'll also need to add at least $20 to your Twilio account in order to start texting.
